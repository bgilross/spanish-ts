			info: [
				"This language course is focused on reuslts and genuine fluency. \nThe aim is to have you thinking in Spanish ASAP, and from there sounding more like a native speaker every day.",
				"Vocab will always make contextual sense. Grammar rules will ALWAYS integrate with what you already know, helping you to naturally form sentences. \nEvery new word will fit into a fabric that will quickly grow and develop into your SPANISH VOICE so that you can speak Idiomatically faster than ever!",
				"This all requires doing the work, step by step from the foundations and working your way up. This requires the mindset of a SERIOUS language learner. ",
				"This program is not focused on vocab, so we won't be learning words for 'tree' or 'napkin' right away, we need to focus on the core elements of the language EXCLUSIVELY first.",
				"This course starts with some hard concepts in Spanish, like essential sentence structures, pronouns, prepositions, irregular verb conjugations, and everything that makes Spanish what it is!",
				"Don't worry though there will by systems involved to help master all of these foundations until they are second nature!",
				"Once you know how to fit Spanish words into sentences we can learn all the vocab that fits into those sentence constructs and idioms.",
				"We actually will be learning the most frequently used Spanish words first, leaning all the words needed to get to 90% comprehension and enabling you to express literally anything you to express in Spanish.",
				"You might not know the word for Office Printer in spanish but you'll be able to describe this thing and ask what it is called, giving you a new vocab word on the spot!",
				"You'll learn fastest if you take an opportunity to predict the Spanish you're about to translate outloud, and especially speak it out loud, trying to imitate the audio!",
				"One of the most important objectives on the road to fluency is SPONTANEOUS PRODUCTION, coming up with your own sentences on the fly, in a smooth way. Practice changing the sentences and making them your own as well!",

				"What is deep fundamental grammar? Well you can't build a house from scratch, you need a foundation first. During the first 10 lessons we are going to build (or rebuild) your Spanish SYNTAX and GRAMMAR from their roots. This will be some of the hardest work in the course ",
				"We will be spending a lot of time on only a few words. In fact 20 words make up 30% of ALL words spoken in Spanish, and about 100 words make up over 50%!",
				"We will be focusing on the first 20. Not just what they mean, but how to use them in a sentence like a Native Speaker would!",
				"Fluency is all about being able to say what you want in Spanish in real time, and you need to not just recite memorized phrases, but create entire Spanish sentences from scratch!",
				"However, actually no one really assembles sentences from scratch, Every real sentence, both in English and Spanish, is actually based on an existing template that Native Speakers use all the time!",
				"Think of the sentence template like a potato head face, all the parts can be changed, the eyes, nose, mouth, you can replace the hat with hair.",
				"But the potato head has a basic structure, on top is hair or a hat of some kind, then the eyes, nose, mouth, it wouldn't be proper to place the mouth on the head.",
				"Sentences function in the same way, there is a basic template, but certain pieces are interchangeable. The parts in a sentence are called parts of speech, and two types are NOUNS and VERBS",

				"Learning to express abstract concepts is more constructive to Deep Language Learning than learning lots of vocab words.",
				"MOST of what we say in any language doesn't consist of simple concrete labels for things, instead we talk about intangible ideas almost constantly",
				"Consider the sentence: `I'd prefer that they do it by this afternoon`, seems simple in English, but to express this in another language requires some really deep knowledge of how the language works.",
				"That sentence is a sort of INTENTION, you are expressing that this IDEA of them doing it by this afernoon is SOMETHING that you want.",
				"This sentence type is commonly seen like: 'I predict that they'll....' or 'I like that they....'",
				"We will learn the words you use for preferring, or predicting, or liking something soon, but currently we want to know exactly HOW and WHERE those words get used in a sentence",
				"Let's play the FOOD game with the previous Sentence; 'I'd prefer that they do it by this afternoon'. \nThis can be turned into 'I'd prefer FOOD!",
				"This is the magic of turning rich, complex ideas into nouns! Imagine mastering the lanugage so well that you can take all you most unique thoughts, opinions, reactions, and interntions, and express them as easily as a simple word like FOOD!",
				"The whole KEY to doing this is the #1 word in Spanish... QUE!. \nThis word lets us take any abstract idea and package it as a NOUN PHRASE to use in a sentence.",
				"In sentences like 'I predict that...' the entire phrase that starts with that / QUE can be treated as the noun, we call this a 'QUE PHRASE!'",
				"A common idiom related to this idea is PARA QUE, meaning 'So that' or 'In order that'",
				"PARA being a Preposition, needs to be followed by a noun, and in this case it is since QUE is the start of the NOUN PHRASE. 'I brought him PARA (QUE he could meet her)'.",
				"Another QUE phrase includes the other qué meaning WHAT, like What Luck!. Qué luck! In English we use HOW for this. HOW strange that he's here = Qué stange QUE he's here!",
				"One last use for QUE the Conjunction (no accent) besides THAT is THAN, as in 'He is taller THAN his brother'.",

			info: [
				"What is the reason you can form Spanish setntences WITHOUT using nouns OR pronouns? \nIt's all to do with a core difference between English and Spanish VERBS.",
				"Think about the forms of SER we've learned. Spanish has FIVE different forms all specific to WHOME it's talking about. \nThat isn't true in English where we would say I AM, you ARE, we ARE, they ARE, she IS. Which is only THREE different words.",
				"In Spanish those words are clearly distinct, specific to who it is that is being talked about. In English if you see 'are' out of context you wouldn't know who it's referring to.",
				"However if you see the word SOMOS in spanish it can ONLY be referring to 'WE'",
				"That allows the Subject Pronouns in Spanish to very often just disappear.",
				"Subject prounouns are any word that is interchangeable with HE, like 'we' 'I' and 'she' etc.. Unlike the previously learned direct object pronouns which are interchangeable with HIM, like 'her' and 'them'.",
				"Consider the sentence: 'He hugged him' HE is the subj pron. and HIM is the dObj pron.",
				"In English we don't leave out subject pronouns always saying things like 'We are friends', where is Spanish you could say simply 'SOMOS friends'",
				"You are allowed to use subject prououns in Spanish, like 'You ERES a nice person' but why bother putting YOU in there, it's already clear from the specificity of ERES who it is you are talking to.",
				"Whether you use the subject pronoun in Spanish depends on how much information you need in the specific context. Say if the subject of the sentence is a whole named noun, you would still include it. Like: 'My DOG es my best friend', but if you have been talking about your dog and it's clear who you are referring to you would just say 'ES my best friend'",
				"One situation in which you would make sure to keep the subject pronoun is when you need to differentiate between two people, like 'SHE no es una thief, HE es un thief'.",
				"Another situation is if you are using emphasis, such as: 'THEY aren't your friends, I am you friend' , They NO SON your friends, I SOY your friend.",
				"Basically, include a subject prounoun if: it's a named noun, or if you need a subject pronoun for emphasis or clarification.",
				"This obviously creates a dilemma where there may subjectively be multiple correct answers. We will notate which sentences do not require Subject Pronouns for now, but this will change.",

			details: "New ways to use SER. SER and Prepositions",
			info: [
				"To give this lesson some context, taks a step back and consider specificaly why you are learning Spanish. \nIs there someone close to you that you want to connect to, or are there specific activities that would be easier, also what specific convsersation topics do you, personall, wish to be able to talk about in fluid spontaneous Spanish?",
				"Go ahead and vividly imagine a conversation you'd like to have in Spanish. Picture who you're talking to, where you are, and what you're talking about. Imagine this conversation being fluid and spontaneous, going in unexpected directions, but imagine that you never get lost! Picture this because our goal is to be there in a few months!",
				"There are some abstract concepts to cover in this lesson, and sometimes this is the most frustrating to get through, especially if you're impatient to start having conversations, but these abstract ideas will be directly applicable to having that conversation you've just imagined",
				"The verb SER is unlike the English TO BE, in that it is VERY specifically used to describe WHAT something IS, or WHO someone IS, as a direct part of their Identity. SER includes the whole family of conjugations we learned in the previous lessons. ES, SON, SOMOS, ERES, SOY, as well as many other forms we haven't learned yet. BUT every form of SER is used in the same way, talking about WHAT something IS",
				"Think about the ways YOU can be described, as a PERSON, or as part of your IDENTITY. What about people or things in your life, what might they be described as 'being', Not as WHERE they are, or HOW they are doing, but as WHAT they are!",
				"This is what SER represents, and it's the key to communicating deeply in Spanish, because it's CORE to how English Linking Verbs are different from Spanish Linking Verbs. If you think about SER/To be in the English sense then you are thinking in English, but start thinking about SER/TO BE as as specific to WHAT something is, or WHO somone IS, then you are starting to think in Spanish!!",
				"So far we've only used SER in the most basic sentences, using straightforwards Nouns or Noun Phrases before and after the form of SER, but it is allowed to follow SER with a preposition in situation where it is directly related to expressing something Identity!",
				"Let's think about how Spanish treats this concept of Identity, consider: 'My mother is/ES from/DE Mexico'. Here SER isn't being followed by a noun but by a preposition and THEN a noun.",
				"Spanish treats 'being from a place' as WHAT you are. If you are FROM New York for example, it's considered part of WHAT YOU ARE. This also applies to a product or food being from a certain place. ",
				"Another Preposition that's used with SER is PARA. For example: 'This gift ES/is PARA/for you' If an Item is intended FOR someone that is considered to be part of it's identity.",
				"Preposition like EN and CON are almost NEVER used after SER, since these two prepositions are almost ALWAYS used to talk about location 'IN/EN the park' or 'WITH/CON my friends'",
				"What about the preposition POR? Is BY or BECAUSE OF associated with SER? Consider the English 'This book is BY that guy'. In English we aren't sure if this is referring to the book being WRITTEN BY the guy, or that the book is NEARY BY the guy. In Spanish using SER makes this a lot more clear, if the book 'ES POR' that guys that clearly means it's written by him and not referring to location! Because of function in the same manner.",
				"Another part of Spanish Identity is physical characteristics, such as 'how tall' would use SER because that is part of someones identity. ",
